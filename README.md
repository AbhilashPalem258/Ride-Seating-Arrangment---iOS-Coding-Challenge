This was done back in 2017 as part of coding challenge to fill the flight seats in the following order
1. Aisle
2. Middle
3. Window

The layout arrangement like number of rows and columns in a particular section is controlled by the variable SeatingArrangementContsnats.seatsCapacityArr. Please feel free to change that value to reflect the layout dynamically.

Right now the value is [(3,12),(4,12), (3,12)] which means 
- First section has 3 seats with 12 rows
- Second section has 4 seats with 12 rows
- Third section has 3 seats with 12 rows
